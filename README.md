# spatial-equity-demo-urban-institute
Cleaning and analyzing census data using Python census API for a demo project

# Overview
Because the product was a demo, the original repo of this project is not public. I was given permission to share what I wrote on a personal repository. 

The goal of this demo is to provide a demonstration of potential updates to the Urban Institute's Spatial Equity tool as part of a pilot project to better respond to the needs of the City of Los Angeles's Office of Equity, Performance, Management, and Innovation.
